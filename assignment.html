            Narendra Modi is the 14th and current Prime Minister of India, serving since 2014.
            Known for his strong leadership, digital initiatives, and commitment to development, Modi has played a significant role in shaping India's modern political landscape.
            His journey from a tea seller to the highest office in the country is an inspiration to millions.Narendra Modi (born September 17, 1950, Vadnagar, India) is an Indian politician and government official who rose to become a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In 2014 he led his party to victory in elections to the Lok Sabha (lower chamber of the Indian parliament), after which he was sworn in as prime minister of India. Prior to that he had served (2001–14) as chief minister (head of government) of Gujarat state in western India. The Modi-led BJP (and the BJP-led NDA alliance) won the majority again in the 2019 general election. Although the BJP failed to secure a majority on its own in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP-led NDA alliance won 293 of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, paving the way for Modi to become the country’s prime minister for a third consecutive term.
